/// Strings, integers, floating-point and Boolean values, and even sets are
/// hashable by default. Some other types, such as optionals, arrays and ranges
/// automatically become hashable when their type arguments implement the same.
///
/// Your own custom types can be hashable as well. When you define an
/// enumeration without associated values, it gains `Hashable` conformance
/// automatically, and you can add `Hashable` conformance to your other custom
/// types by implementing the `hash(into:)` method. For structs whose stored
/// properties are all `Hashable`, and for enum types that have all-`Hashable`
/// associated values, the compiler is able to provide an implementation of
/// `hash(into:)` automatically.
///
/// Hashing a value means feeding its essential components into a hash function,
/// represented by the `Hasher` type. Essential components are those that
/// contribute to the type's implementation of `Equatable`. Two instances that
/// are equal must feed the same values to `Hasher` in `hash(into:)`, in the
/// same order.
///
/// Conforming to the Hashable Protocol
/// ===================================
///
/// To use your own custom type in a set or as the key type of a dictionary,
/// add `Hashable` conformance to your type. The `Hashable` protocol inherits
/// from the `Equatable` protocol, so you must also satisfy that protocol's

///
/// - For a `struct`, all its stored properties must conform to `Hashable`.
/// - For an `enum`, all its associated values must conform to `Hashable`. (An
///   `enum` without associated values has `Hashable` conformance even without
///   the declaration.)
///
/// To customize your type's `Hashable` conformance, to adopt `Hashable` in a
/// type that doesn't meet the criteria listed above, or to extend an existing
/// type to conform to `Hashable`, implement the `hash(into:)` method in your
/// custom type.
///
/// In your `hash(into:)` implementation, call `combine(_:)` on the provided
/// `Hasher` instance with the essential components of your type. To ensure
/// that your type meets the semantic requirements of the `Hashable` and
/// `Equatable` protocols, it's a good idea to also customize your type's
/// `Equatable` conformance to match.
///

/// grid of buttons. Here's the initial declaration of the `GridPoint` type:
///
///     /// A point in an x-y coordinate system.
///     struct GridPoint {
///         var x: Int
///         var y: Int
///     }
///
/// You'd like to create a set of the grid points where a user has already
/// tapped. Because the `GridPoint` type is not hashable yet, it can't be used
/// in a set. To add `Hashable` conformance, provide an `==` operator function
/// and implement the `hash(into:)` method.

/// As an example, here's an implementation of a `Date` structure that stores

///     struct Date {
///         let year: Int

/// `Equatable`.
///
/// Some sequence and collection operations can be used more simply when the

///
/// Conforming to the Equatable Protocol
/// ====================================
///
/// Adding `Equatable` conformance to your custom types means that you can use
/// more convenient APIs when searching for particular instances in a
/// collection. `Equatable` is also the base protocol for the `Hashable` and
/// `Comparable` protocols, which allow more uses of your custom type, such as
/// constructing sets or sorting the elements of a collection.
///
/// You can rely on automatic synthesis of the `Equatable` protocol's
/// requirements for a custom type when you declare `Equatable` conformance in
/// the type's original declaration and your type meets these criteria:
///
/// - For a `struct`, all its stored properties must conform to `Equatable`.
/// - For an `enum`, all its associated values must conform to `Equatable`. (An
///   `enum` without associated values has `Equatable` conformance even
///   without the declaration.)
///
/// To customize your type's `Equatable` conformance, to adopt `Equatable` in a
/// type that doesn't meet the criteria listed above, or to extend an existing
/// type to conform to `Equatable`, implement the equal-to operator (`==`) as
/// a static method of your type. The standard library provides an
/// implementation for the not-equal-to operator (`!=`) for any `Equatable`
/// type, which calls the custom `==` function and negates its result.
///
/// As an example, consider a `StreetAddress` class that holds the parts of a
/// street address: a house or building number, the street name, and an
/// optional unit number. Here's the initial declaration of the
/// `StreetAddress` type:
///
///     class StreetAddress {
///         let number: String
///         let street: String
///         let unit: String?
///
///         init(_ number: String, _ street: String, unit: String? = nil) {
///             self.number = number
///             self.street = street
///             self.unit = unit
///         }
///     }
///
/// Now suppose you have an array of addresses that you need to check for a
/// particular address. To use the `contains(_:)` method without including a
/// closure in each call, extend the `StreetAddress` type to conform to
/// `Equatable`.
///
///     extension StreetAddress: Equatable {
///         static func == (lhs: StreetAddress, rhs: StreetAddress) -> Bool {
///             return
///                 lhs.number == rhs.number &&
///                 lhs.street == rhs.street &&
///                 lhs.unit == rhs.unit
///         }
///     }
///
/// The `StreetAddress` type now conforms to `Equatable`. You can use `==` to
/// check for equality between any two instances or call the
/// `Equatable`-constrained `contains(_:)` method.
///
///     let addresses = [StreetAddress("1490", "Grove Street"),
///                      StreetAddress("2119", "Maple Avenue"),
///                      StreetAddress("1400", "16th Street")]
///     let home = StreetAddress("1400", "16th Street")
///
///     print(addresses[0] == home)
///     // Prints "false"
///     print(addresses.contains(home))
///     // Prints "true"
///
/// Equality implies substitutability---any two instances that compare equally
/// can be used interchangeably in any code that depends on their values. To
/// maintain substitutability, the `==` operator should take into account all
/// visible aspects of an `Equatable` type. Exposing nonvalue aspects of
/// `Equatable` types other than class identity is discouraged, and any that
/// *are* exposed should be explicitly pointed out in documentation.
///
/// Since equality between instances of `Equatable` types is an equivalence
/// relation, any of your custom types that conform to `Equatable` must
/// satisfy three conditions, for any values `a`, `b`, and `c`:
///
/// - `a == a` is always `true` (Reflexivity)
/// - `a == b` implies `b == a` (Symmetry)
/// - `a == b` and `b == c` implies `a == c` (Transitivity)
///
/// Moreover, inequality is the inverse of equality, so any custom
/// implementation of the `!=` operator must guarantee that `a != b` implies
/// `!(a == b)`. The default implementation of the `!=` operator function
/// satisfies this requirement.
///
/// Equality is Separate From Identity
/// ----------------------------------
///
/// The identity of a class instance is not part of an instance's value.
/// Consider a class called `IntegerRef` that wraps an integer value. Here's
/// the definition for `IntegerRef` and the `==` function that makes it
/// conform to `Equatable`:
///
///     class IntegerRef: Equatable {
///         let value: Int

///             return lhs.value == rhs.value

///     let b = IntegerRef(100)
///
///     print(a == a, a == b, separator: ", ")
///     // Prints "true, true"

/// ------------------------
///
/// You use the default `init(_:)` initializer to create a new instance when

///     // e == 127
///
///     let f = Int8(128.25)
///     // Error: Double value cannot be converted...
///
///
/// Exact Conversion
/// ----------------
///
/// Use the `init?(exactly:)` initializer to create a new instance after
/// checking whether the passed value is representable. Instead of trapping on

/// checks both that the passed value has no fractional part and that the

///
///     let e = Int8(exactly: 23.0)       // integral value, representable
///     // e == Optional(23)

///

/// -------------------
///
/// Use the `init(clamping:)` initializer to create a new instance of a binary
/// integer type where out-of-range values are clamped to the representable
/// range of the type. For a type `T`, the resulting value is in the range
/// `T.min...T.max`.
///
///     let x = Int16(clamping: 500)

///     // y == 127
///
///     let z = UInt8(clamping: -500)
///     // z == 0
///
/// Bit Pattern Conversion
/// ----------------------
///
/// Use the `init(truncatingIfNeeded:)` initializer to create a new instance
/// with the same bit pattern as the passed value, extending or truncating the
/// value's representation as necessary. Note that the value may not be
/// preserved, particularly when converting between signed to unsigned integer

/// Comparing Across Integer Types
/// ==============================
///
/// You can use relational operators, such as the less-than and equal-to
/// operators (`<` and `==`), to compare instances of different binary integer
/// types. The following example compares instances of the `Int`, `UInt`, and
/// `UInt8` types:
///
///     let x: Int = -23
///     let y: UInt = 1_000
///     let z: UInt8 = 23
///
///     if x < y {
///         print("\(x) is less than \(y).")
///     }
///     // Prints "-23 is less than 1000."
///
///     if z > x {
///         print("\(z) is greater than \(x).")
///     }
///     // Prints "23 is greater than -23."
/// An integer type that uses a fixed size for every instance.
///
/// The `FixedWidthInteger` protocol adds binary bitwise operations, bit
/// shifts, and overflow handling to the operations supported by the
/// `BinaryInteger` protocol.
///
/// Use the `FixedWidthInteger` protocol as a constraint or extension point
/// when writing operations that depend on bit shifting, performing bitwise
/// operations, catching overflows, or having access to the maximum or minimum
/// representable value of a type. For example, the following code provides a
/// `binaryString` property on every fixed-width integer that represents the
/// number's binary representation, split into 8-bit chunks.
///
///     extension FixedWidthInteger {
///         var binaryString: String {
///             var result: [String] = []
///             for i in 0..<(Self.bitWidth / 8) {
///                 let byte = UInt8(truncatingIfNeeded: self >> (i * 8))
///                 let byteString = String(byte, radix: 2)
///                 let padding = String(repeating: "0",
///                                      count: 8 - byteString.count)
///                 result.append(padding + byteString)
///             }
///             return "0b" + result.reversed().joined(separator: "_")
///         }
///     }
///
///     print(Int16.max.binaryString)
///     // Prints "0b01111111_11111111"
///     print((101 as UInt8).binaryString)
///     // Prints "0b11001001"
///
/// The `binaryString` implementation uses the static `bitWidth` property and
/// the right shift operator (`>>`), both of which are available to any type
/// that conforms to the `FixedWidthInteger` protocol.
///
/// The next example declares a generic `squared` function, which accepts an
/// instance `x` of any fixed-width integer type. The function uses the
/// `multipliedReportingOverflow(by:)` method to multiply `x` by itself and
/// check whether the result is too large to represent in the same type.
///
///     func squared<T: FixedWidthInteger>(_ x: T) -> T? {
///         let (result, overflow) = x.multipliedReportingOverflow(by: x)
///         if overflow {

/// declare the required initializers, properties, and methods. The required
